# ViciPhone 2.0
An improved webphone for the Vicidial Call Center Suite.

This code is a fork from the original code by Michael Cargile (https://github.com/vicimikec/ViciPhone), and as such contains the following enhancements:

- Uses SIPJS version 0.15.10 as of 2020-06-15, supporting all modern browsers.
- Allows SIPJS to be downloaded from a CDN as minified version.
- Support for multiple translations. Currently adds spanish support, but is open for more.
- Can call the agent instantly after the webphone has loaded (like a regular softphone), saving time and human error.

Several other improvements can be read in the commits logfile.
